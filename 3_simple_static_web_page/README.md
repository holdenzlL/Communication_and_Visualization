# Assignment

Using a text editor please write a html file that contains some personal information about you.

Could be:    

- headline: Personal Info - Name
- pic    
- Address    
- Phone number    
- email    
- matrix id    
- ...    

Please use plain html and write it yourself, no need for generated html. Open it with your browser (check different) directly from the disk. 
Any other web page idea also is welcome. 

In a second step please use cascading style sheets (in an extra file) to change the appearance of your web page.

Open it in your browser (best is: try different and compare) and also check for browser built-in support for web pages and checks.

Please write a short report on the results and upload it here together with your sources.



Documentation on html you can find in internet, e.g. here: https://www.w3schools.com

# Solution

The solution to this project relates to another project of mine which is about construction of my own website.

Although I rewrote everything in JavaScript, I need to protect my website safety.

Thus, the solution is not opensource, only the report is published.
