# Assignment

There is an introductory example on Ilias, please try.

**Please use the mini http server or another server** you installed. In case of your own server, please also install perl, if not yet installed. Take care your perl scripts really run on the server. You can also try to use on two different machines.

Task:

\- Please create a webpage including a form that asks for some data. (Which data is up to you, just choose an example you like).

\- Make the submit button call a perl script on the server. Please create this script. The script receives the data and

a.) outputs the same data again in a response html site, that the script dynamically creates and the server sends to the client 

b.) Stores the received values in a text file on the server.

c.) Write an extra script that reads this text file and outputs a dynamic table with these values. Add a link to this script in your original web page.

(Please note that we do not do any locking etc for multi-tasking/multiple access to this file).

Please note that there is a deadline. Please submit here.

Please be aware which parts run on the client side and which on the server side. If possible also try with two machines.

# Solution

The front end part to this project relates to another project of mine which is about construction of my own website.

Although I rewrote everything in JavaScript, I need to protect my website safety.

Thus, the front end part is not opensource.

But I will keep the whole project encrypted compression there :) for my own storage
