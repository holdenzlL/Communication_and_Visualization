# Assignment

Please modify the C(++) example program available on Ilias to download any file from a webserver.

(Use webservers inside the campus network as long as you are at university, since we do not code to use the proxy. )

The file should have the same name as on the server. 

Hint: Check with an image file if you correctly got the empty line separating the header parameters from the file data.

Please upload a small report explaining the changes to the program, also include screenshot(s).

You also can use the wireshark program to check for the exchanged messages.

Please keep the deadline.
